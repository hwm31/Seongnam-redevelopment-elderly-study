=== Before Redevelopment Multiple Regression Analysis Results (Odd Years Only) ===

Note: Analysis includes only odd years (2017, 2019, 2023)
2023 Place_Attachment values were reversed during processing
Settlement_Mindset mapping: 1,3→strong(4); 2,4→weak(1-2)


=== Before Redevelopment - Ridge Multiple Regression Equation ===
Residence_Satisfaction = 2.4555 - 0.0764 × Age + 0.0975 × Residence_Period - 0.0832 × Future_Residence_Intent - 0.0630 × Settlement_Mindset - 0.3096 × Place_Attachment - 0.1049 × Monthly_Income + 0.0192 × Has_Debt - 0.2013 × Life_Satisfaction

--- Coefficient Interpretation ---
1. Place_Attachment: -0.3096 (1 unit increase → residence satisfaction decreases)
2. Life_Satisfaction: -0.2013 (1 unit increase → residence satisfaction decreases)
3. Monthly_Income: -0.1049 (1 unit increase → residence satisfaction decreases)
4. Residence_Period: 0.0975 (1 unit increase → residence satisfaction increases)
5. Future_Residence_Intent: -0.0832 (1 unit increase → residence satisfaction decreases)

--- Feature Meanings (Odd Years Only) ---
Age: age in years
Residence_Period: years of residence
Future_Residence_Intent: 1=strongly agree ~ 5=strongly disagree
Settlement_Mindset: 1,3=strong attachment; 2,4=weak attachment (Note: 1,3→4 strong; 2,4→1-2 weak)
Place_Attachment: 1=none ~ 4=very strong (Note: 2023 values were reversed during processing)
Monthly_Income: 1=<100만원 ~ 8=700만원+
Has_Debt: 1=yes, 2=no
Life_Satisfaction: 1=very satisfied ~ 5=very dissatisfied
