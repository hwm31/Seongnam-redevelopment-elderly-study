=== After Redevelopment - Ridge Multiple Regression Equation ===
Residence_Satisfaction = 2.5510 + 0.0236 × Age + 0.0001 × Residence_Period + 0.0502 × Future_Residence_Intent_Pos + 0.0251 × Settlement_Mindset - 0.0558 × Place_Attachment + 0.1473 × Housing_Satisfaction + 0.0085 × Monthly_Income + 0.0153 × Debt_Free + 0.4621 × Life_Satisfaction_Pos - 0.0380 × Public_Transport_Satisfaction + 0.0000 × year

--- Coefficient Interpretation (Sorted by Importance) ---
1. Life_Satisfaction_Pos: 0.4621 (abs=0.4621) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
2. Housing_Satisfaction: 0.1473 (abs=0.1473) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
