All coefficients are sorted by importance (absolute value)


=== After Redevelopment - Ridge Multiple Regression Equation ===
Residence_Satisfaction = 2.4664 - 0.1333 × Age + 0.1075 × Residence_Period + 0.1649 × Future_Residence_Intent + 0.0254 × Settlement_Mindset - 0.0796 × Place_Attachment - 0.1657 × Monthly_Income - 0.0570 × Has_Debt + 0.2703 × Life_Satisfaction + 0.0000 × year

--- Coefficient Interpretation (Sorted by Importance) ---
1. Life_Satisfaction: 0.2703 (abs=0.2703) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
2. Monthly_Income: -0.1657 (abs=0.1657) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction decreases
3. Future_Residence_Intent: 0.1649 (abs=0.1649) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
4. Age: -0.1333 (abs=0.1333) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction decreases
5. Residence_Period: 0.1075 (abs=0.1075) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
6. Place_Attachment: -0.0796 (abs=0.0796) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction decreases
7. Has_Debt: -0.0570 (abs=0.0570) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction decreases
8. Settlement_Mindset: 0.0254 (abs=0.0254) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction increases
9. year: 0.0000 (abs=0.0000) → 1 unit ↑ = residence satisfaction decreases
