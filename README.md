# The Impact of Redevelopment on Older Adults
Case Study of Seongnam City with Policy Recommendations

## 🏙️ Project Overview

This project analyzes the level of age-friendliness across cities and counties in Gyeonggi-do, with a focus on Seongnam-si, where urban redevelopment and population aging are occurring simultaneously. As Korea entered an aged society in 2017, older adults have become increasingly vulnerable, especially in redevelopment areas.

## 🔍 Key Objectives
	•	Evaluate the age-friendliness of Seongnam-si using provincial data.
	•	Identify key factors affecting elderly quality of life (e.g., transportation, welfare services, safety).
	•	Use machine learning to determine the main predictors of residential satisfaction.
	•	Propose policy recommendations to support residential stability and well-being for older adults during redevelopment.

Seongnam-si, especially its older districts (e.g., Sujeong-gu and Jungwon-gu), illustrates the urgent need to improve age-friendliness in the face of redevelopment. This project aims to guide policy toward more inclusive, senior-friendly urban planning.
